# Cryptocurrencies

# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis on cryptocurrencies and break them into groups based of of their features. The endo goal of this is to propose to a bank or investment firm for a cryptocurrency portfolio. This will be accomplished using unsupervised machine learning. This was performed using the following resources: 
- Data provided by CryptoCompare
- Python's Pandas library
- Python's Plotly library
- Pythons's scikit-learn library


## Establishing the Elbow Curve
Since we do not know the optimal number of clusters to use for this analysis we're going to create an elbow curve.

This allows us to see the best number of clusters to use is 4. 

## 3D Scatter Plot

Here we can see the currencies plotted on a Plotly 3D Scatter Plot.
